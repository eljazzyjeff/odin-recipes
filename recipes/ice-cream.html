            <h1>The Best Peach Ice Cream Recipe</h1>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A generous portion of peach puree and chunks of fresh peaches went into this deliciously soft
                peach ice cream. It is all that peaches and cream are about. Silky texture, sweetness and deep fruity
                flavour. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This lovely ice cream is best served with some fresh fruit. While I chose the cheaper, overripe ones
                for the ice cream itself, I tend to splurge when it comes to dishing this dessert up. Whenever they
                are available I buy flat peaches; they are a little bit pricey but well worth it. They also go by the name
                Saturn peaches or donut (doughnut) peaches and while they carry less juice than the regular peach
                they are so much sweeter.

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the contents of the coconut milk cans into a saucepan.
                        If it is the first time you use coconut milk in a can then don’t
                        be alarmed by seeing a thick layer of rather a solid cream
                        and a big part of milky water. That is normal. It happens
                        because the coconut milk separates inside the can. Take a
                        whisk and stir until everything is evenly combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take about 125 ml (1/2 cup) of the coconut milk out of the
                        pan and set aside in a small bowl. Add the arrow root powder
                        to the small portion of coconut milk in the small bowl. The
                        arrowroot powder will make sure the base thickens once this
                        is added to the bigger pan. Mix until it is perfectly combined
                        and place aside for now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Return to the saucepan and add the 4 tbsp of cane sugar,
                        salt and vanilla. Gently heat over low to medium heat and stir
                        until the sweetener is dissolved and all is well combined.
                        Heat until warm but not boiling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the arrow root powder and coconut mixture into the
                        warm coconut milk and whisk. Increase the heat to medium
                        and keep whisking – don’t leave the pot now. Make sure to
                        whisk it now and then while making sure the heat is not too
                        high. It is crucial never to let it come to a boil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In about 5-7 minutes the arrow root powder will thicken the
                        mixture, and you will be left with a beautiful ice cream base
                        that only needs chilling in the fridge. You will know it is done
                        when you can draw a line with a fingertip on the back of a
                        wooden spoon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I chill my ice cream base in a small metal bowl and place a
                        plate on top of it. You will have a small layer of skin forming
                        on the top of the mixture though you can prevent that by
                        stirring it every 10 minutes while it cools down. It is not
                        necessary though because the processing in the ice cream
                        machine usually takes care of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the ice cream base is cooling down in the fridge, split
                        your peaches into two portions. Reserve 250g (1/2 lb ) of the
                        peaches and place them in the fridge. Chop the remaining
                        roughly up and the peaches with 2 tbsp cane sugar to a
                        blender. Process until it is very smooth and no speckles of
                        skin can be seen anymore.*
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the puree into a saucepan and simmer on low heat until
                        it is reduced to about 1/3 of its original volume. You can
                        measure it in between to be sure if you want. Remove the
                        puree from the heat and let it cool down.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once both the ice cream base and the peach puree have
                        cooled down, peel and chop the 250g (1/2 lb) of the
                        peaches that you stored in the fridge and cut them into little
                        cubes, they will be added to the ice cream.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the ice cream base and the fruit puree into the ice
                        cream maker and follow its instructions. When the ice cream
                        is nearly done, add the fruit chunks and let the ice cream
                        maker mix them in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer the soft ice cream it to a container, scatter a few
                        peach cubes on top if you want and cover it with wax paper.
                        Leave the ice cream in the freezer for another 2 hours. Doing
                        this will give you the perfect ice cream that can be scooped
                        neatly. To serve take it out of the freezer for a few minutes to
                        soften. Scoop it into bowls and serve with fresh fruit if you have.
