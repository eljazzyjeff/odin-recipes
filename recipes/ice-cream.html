        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A generous portion of peach puree and chunks of fresh peaches went into this deliciously soft
            peach ice cream. It is all that peaches and cream are about. Silky texture, sweetness and deep fruity
            flavour. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This lovely ice cream is best served with some fresh fruit. While I chose the cheaper, overripe ones
            for the ice cream itself, I tend to splurge when it comes to dishing this dessert up. Whenever they
            are available I buy flat peaches; they are a little bit pricey but well worth it. They also go by the name
            Saturn peaches or donut (doughnut) peaches and while they carry less juice than the regular peach
            they are so much sweeter.
