        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Compared to American and French ice creams, Italian-style gelato is made with less cream. Surprisingly,
            this translates to a denser, richer texture, since cream traps more air bubbles than milk when churned.
            Gelato also melts faster on the tongue, and the neutral base intensifies added flavors—in this case, pistachio.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a deliriously good pistachio gelato, you need deliriously good—and accordingly expensive—pistachio
            paste. Agrimontana’s Sicilian paste is a dark, fragrant, and almost juicy expression of the queen of nuts,
            made with nothing more than pistachios and added pistachio oil for a silky texture. If you can’t swing the
            Sicilian stuff, look for a paste with only pistachios, oil, and salt, and avoid products labeled “pistachio
            cream,” an indicator that the pistachio content has been cut with sugars and stabilizers.
