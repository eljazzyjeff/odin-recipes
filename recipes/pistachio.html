        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Compared to American and French ice creams, Italian-style gelato is made with less cream. Surprisingly,
            this translates to a denser, richer texture, since cream traps more air bubbles than milk when churned.
            Gelato also melts faster on the tongue, and the neutral base intensifies added flavors—in this case, pistachio.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a deliriously good pistachio gelato, you need deliriously good—and accordingly expensive—pistachio
            paste. Agrimontana’s Sicilian paste is a dark, fragrant, and almost juicy expression of the queen of nuts,
            made with nothing more than pistachios and added pistachio oil for a silky texture. If you can’t swing the
            Sicilian stuff, look for a paste with only pistachios, oil, and salt, and avoid products labeled “pistachio
            cream,” an indicator that the pistachio content has been cut with sugars and stabilizers.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 Tbsp. pure pistachio paste (not pistachio cream)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until well combined. Whisk in the milk,
                cream, and salt until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until a thermometer inserted into
                the mixture reads 170°. Remove from the heat and whisk in the pistachio paste until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set a fine strainer over an airtight container and pour the mixture through. Cover and refrigerate
                overnight or up to 3 days (this helps cooked custard bases achieve a stable consistency).

                In the bowl of an ice cream maker, churn the mixture according to the manufacturer’s directions until
                it’s firm and billowy, and a spoon dragged across the top leaves a lasting impression, about 30 minutes.
                Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until hardened, at least 4-5 hours. Later on, if it’s too firm,
                thaw it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes before scooping and serving. For best results, eat within 2
                days of freezing.
