        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This pink ice cream is made with pitaya, also known as dragon fruit, high in iron,
            magnesium and fiber and tastes like kiwi - enjoy this healthy treat!
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of almond milk and canned coconut milk keep this ice cream creamy
            and vegan. It also gives it a hint of a tropical dessert, which I love. It really
            couldn’t be any easier to throw this ice cream together…just a quick run through
            the blender and then straight into an ice cream maker.
